<br>

<p>Immediately pull the nearest fire alarm pull station as you exit the building.
When evacuating the building, be sure to feel doors for heat before opening them to be sure there is no fire danger on the other side.
</p>

<p>
If there is smoke in the air, stay low to the ground, especially your head, to reduce inhalation exposure. Keep on hand on the wall to prevent disorientation and crawl to the nearest exit.
Once away and clear from danger, call your report contact and inform them of the fire.
Go to your refuge area and await further instructions from emergency personnel.

<p>Keep doorways, corridors and egress paths clear and unobstructed. Make sure that all electrical appliances and cords are in good condition and UL approved. Do not overload electrical outlets. Use surge protected multi-outlet power strips and extension cords when necessary.</p>
<p>Never store flammable materials in your room or apartment.
Do not tamper with any fire system equipment such as smoke detectors, pull stations or fire extinguishers. Doing so is a criminal offense.</p>
<p>Raising a false alarm is a criminal offense. It endangers the lives of the occupants and emergency personnel.</p>
